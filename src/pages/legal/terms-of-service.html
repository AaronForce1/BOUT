        </p>
				<p>
          Agreement not with Apple, but Apple terms govern if more restrictive: B-OUT and you acknowledge that this Agreement is concluded between B-OUT and you only, and not with Apple, and B-OUT, not Apple, is solely responsible for B-OUT app and the content thereof.

			<li>Apple as Third Party Beneficiary

        </p>
      </li>
			<li>Arbitration, Class Waiver, and Jury Waiver
        <p>
          PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH B-OUT, AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
        </p>
				<p>
          Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the Terms or the use the Services that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and B-OUT are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.
        </p>
				<p>
          Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
        </p>
				<p>
          Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.
        </p>
				<p>
          Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and B-OUT. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and B-OUT.
        </p>
				<p>
          Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND B-OUT WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and B-OUT are instead electing to have all claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. If any litigation should arise between you and B-OUT over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND B-OUT WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
        </p>
				<p>
          Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration and instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 26.
        </p>
				<p>
          Confidentiality. No part of the procedures will be open to the public or the media. All evidence discovered or submitted at the hearing is confidential and may not be disclosed, except by written agreement of the parties, pursuant to court order, or unless required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party will be prevented from submitting to a court of law any information needed to enforce this arbitration agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
        </p>
				<p>
          Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this arbitration agreement.
        </p>
				<p>
          Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or B-OUT may bring an individual action in small claims court.
        </p>
				<p>
          Arbitration Agreement Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with B-OUT.
        </p>
				<p>
          YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR THE B-OUT UNIVERSE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED.
        </p>
      </li>
			<li>Forum and Venue
        <p>
          To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, both you and B-OUT agree that all claims and disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. If, however, that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all claims and disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of the Services must be litigated exclusively in the Supreme Court of New York, County of New York. You and B-OUT consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts.
        </p>
      </li>
			<li>Choice of Law
        <p>
          The laws of the State of New York, other than its conflict-of-laws principles, will govern all disputes between you and B-OUT, but only to the extent they are not preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act.
        </p>
      </li>
			<li>Miscellaneous
        <p>
          You agree that B-OUT may assign any of its rights and licenses granted hereunder and/or transfer, sub-contract or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without restriction.  This Agreement is personal to you and you may not transfer or assign it to a third party.
        </p>
				<p>
          Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
        </p>
				<p>
          If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law including but not limited to the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations stated above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in effect.
        </p>

          B-OUT may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to these Terms of Service, by email or postings on the B-OUT Universe.

Notice to you will be deemed given twenty- four hours after an email is sent, unless B-OUT is notified that the email address is invalid.
