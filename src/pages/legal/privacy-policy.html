      <li>Application of Privacy Policy
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy applies solely to B-OUT and the B-OUT Universe. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected at any Web site, products or any services not owned or operated by B-OUT, including any third-party Web site reached through a link on or through the Service. You are responsible for reviewing and understanding the privacy policies of any such third party. We have no control over, and we assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies or practices of any such third party.  By using the Service, you release B-OUT from any claim or liability arising from your use of any such third-party Website, products or services.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Information You Choose to Submit
        <p>
          Personal Information.  We collect information that personally identifies you, such as your first and last name, email address and other data that can be reasonably linked to such information (“Personal Information”) only if you choose to share such information with us. For example, you will be required to provide us with certain Personal Information to register with the Site or mobile application and become a B-OUT member, sign up for certain services available through the Service (such as email communications and other notifications), purchase products through the Service, and at other times. The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you decide not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Service. You may review, correct, update or change your Personal Information by editing your profile via the Service. If you decide you no longer wish to receive email communications, push or in-App notifications from us, please follow the iOS alert instructions provided in the app, the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail communications or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@bout.lgbt">support@bout.lgbt</a>.

          Public Profile and Postings.  By using the Service you may make certain of your Personal Information available to others. [For your public profile we will display your profile image, your first name, and also certain actions you take within the Service. For example, if you post a comment in a public area of the B-OUT Universe, other users may see your name and other information from your public profile that you choose to make available to others. Information you choose to make publicly available may be accessed by users who use the Service and may be accessed by commercial search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and Bing to the extent that such engines are permitted to access the Site.

        <p>
          When you post things like photos or videos on the Service, we may receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the time, date and place you took the photo or video.  You have the ability to add photos and videos to your B-OUT profile if you wish to do so.

For example, your public profile will show the number of connections you have and the number of users you are connected to.

        </p>
        <p>
          Your Feedback.  If you send us personal correspondence, such as e-mails or letters, we may keep a record of that correspondence. We also periodically ask users for feedback that we use to improve the Service and products and add new features. If you respond to these requests, we may keep a record of your response.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Account.  You should not grant anyone access to your account. B-OUT does not and cannot control how anyone else may use your information or account.  Personal Information you provide to others may not be protected, kept private or be secure.

You are solely responsible for all use of your account, by yourself or anyone who uses it. B-OUT will not be liable for any disclosure or use of Personal Information or other information by you or anyone using your account..
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Information We Automatically Collect
        <p>
          Non Personal Information.  We automatically collect information that does not reflect or reference an individually identifiable user (“Non-Personal Information”). Like most Web sites, we automatically collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files may include the IP address of the computer or server that you are using to access the Services, the IP address and/or the URL from the Web site you visited just before you visited our Services, the URL of the page you visit upon leaving the Services, if any, the type of browser and operating system you are using, the browser language, and the date and time of your visit. This anonymous usage information may be associated with your B-OUT Username and profile, but we will not disclose the associated information to third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mobile Devices.  When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more device identifiers (the “Device ID”).  For example, if you install the B-OUT app on an Apple device, we may store your IMEI, ICCID or MEID.  On an Android device, the Device ID can include the IMEI, MEID or ESN. We may use this data to help detect unauthorized access to your B-OUT account.  Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by B-OUT.  A device identifier may deliver information to us about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

          Geo-Location Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          [To provide location-based services on our applications, B-OUT and our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your device. Where available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices’ approximate location. Unless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by B-OUT and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services. For example, your device may share its geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.]
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Information Others Share About You
        <p>
          [Through the Service, you may elect to access third-party services and applications, such as Facebook and other social networks.  When you do so, you may be able to import information from those other services and applications and share content with those services.  Some of those third-party services may also provide us with information from your accounts which may enable us to enhance and personalize your use of the Service.  If you elect to enable such third-party services or applications on B-OUT, the information you share with such third-party services and applications will be subject to their privacy policies and your privacy settings for such services.  Please note that information you imported from third party services to the B-OUT Universe will then be subject to this Privacy Policy and B-OUT’s Terms of Service. You also may be able to control or block such sharing by changing your privacy settings in such services or applications.]

      </li>
      <li>Cookies and Web Beacons
        <p>
          [B-OUT’s websites, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          [B-OUT and its partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.]

        <p>
          Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.]
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>How We Use Your Information
        <p>
          We may use Personal Information and Non-Personal Information for internal purposes, such as to notify you of new features, products or services, to provide customer support, to process transactions, to customize the content and advertising you see, to improve the Service, to conduct research, to solicit your feedback and input about the Service and to provide more relevant products, services and advertisements on or through the Service.

        </p>
        <p>
          We will not sell, share or rent Personal Information to third parties, including, without limitation, for their direct marketing purposes, and we will not otherwise disclose such information to third parties, without your express permission or as expressly disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours (“Service Providers”). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services on our behalf, such as payment processing, hosting and maintenance, data storage and management services, marketing, promotion, sweepstakes and contest administrations. We provide our Service Providers with the information reasonably necessary for them to perform these services, which information may include certain Personal Information such as your name and email address.  Each Service Provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may use, and disclose to third parties, certain Non-Personal Information regarding the Services (e.g., the aggregate number of users in a certain age group or from a particular geographic location, etc.).  However, such information does not identify you individually.
        </p>
        <p>
          In certain instances, we may disclose your information when we believe it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities in order to protect B-OUT, our users or the public, to enforce or apply our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy or when we believe that the law or legal process requires such disclosure. For example, we may share information to reduce the risk of fraud or if someone uses or attempts to use the Service for illegal reasons, such as an intellectual property rights violation, or to commit fraud.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, in the event that B-OUT is merged, sold or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer all your personal information in connection with such transaction.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Communications
        <p>
          We may communicate with you at various times, with administrative emails, about transactions and Service announcements, customer service responses and promotional emails like special offers, newsletters and updates.

      <li>B-OUT Invitiations
        <p>
          [If you choose to invite friends and family members to join B-OUT, we will ask you for your invitee’s name and email address.

The B-OUT system does not display your invitee’s email address to others on the Service.  Your invitee may contact us at support@bout.lgbt to request that we remove this information from our database.]
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Security
        <p>
          Information that we collect is stored on servers, using standard security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information in an effort to protect information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
